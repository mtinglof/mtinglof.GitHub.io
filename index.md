## Hello World!

I’m a current undergraduate at San Diego State University, receiving a Bachelors of Science in Statistical Computing. I’ll be graduating Winter 2019. 

Statistical Analytics, Web Scrapping, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence are my key interests.  

### A Cool Fact About Myself 

There is a [peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglof_Peninsula) in the Antarctic named “Tinglof Peninsula” after my relative Ivor Tinglof (pictured in the middle of the photograph) 
He is credited for making the first heavy cargo sleds for use in the Antarctic!
